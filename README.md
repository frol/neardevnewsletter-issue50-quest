# NEAR Dev News #50 - Quest

We celebrate the 50th issue of NEAR Dev News.

You will only need to read the code, think through it, and find the way to hack it to get 50 NEAR.

When a user calls `nearai_tellme` on the contract (see the `./contract` folder) deployed to [`neardevnewsletter-issue50.frol.near`](https://nearblocks.io/address/neardevnewsletter-issue50.frol.near), the contract will emit an event that NEAR AI will handle with the [deployed agent](https://app.near.ai/agents/frol.near/convince-me-near-dev-newsletter/latest/source) (see `./agent` folder), which is instructed to call the contract back.

Show your love to NEAR and get 50 NEAR in return!

Nice tools to have on your side:

* [NEAR CLI](https://near.cli.rs) or [Lantstool](https://app.lantstool.dev) to make function calls to contracts
* [NearBlocks](https://nearblocks.io) to inspect the transactions history
